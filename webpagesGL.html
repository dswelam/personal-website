        <p>
            Hello! My name is Dania Swelam, I am currently a junior at NC State University.
            I am majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and minoring in Statistics. I also plan on
            doing an <ins>Artificial Intelligence Concentration</ins>. I chose to major in Computer Science
            because it allows me to express my creativity through coding and software development.
            Whether it's software design, developing algorithms, or building innovative systems,
            the process of engineering offers me the opportunity to express my <em>creativity</em> while
            contributing to advancements that shape the world around us.
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 16px; color: #FFFFFF; text-align: left;">
            Before enrolling at NC State, I held a certification as an English as a Foreign
            Language Teacher. Over the span of ten years, with six of those dedicated to teaching
            English to children and young adults in Saudi Arabia, I found immense gratification
            in this role. Being able to spread knowledge as an educator filled me with joy and
            satisfaction. As my passion for computer science grew, I became eager to further my
            own learning and pursue a degree in the field. I hope to become a Full Stack Software Developer
            post-graduation.
